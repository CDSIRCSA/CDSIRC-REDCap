Fed entirely via gastronomy button.  Unable to communicate| severely dependent.   Child was physically unable to cough so he was unable to expel collection on his lungs –on high levels of oxygen.  Active treatment was withdrawn and the child died on the same day.  Mother’s defacto partner was prosecuted but not convicted of the offence  Active concerns for child’s half siblings    1/2011 On coronial list re finding.  1/2011 Still open with coroner.  8/2011; Finding made. - Have file been requested????    Feb 2012 - Files reviewed by Di Gursansky  Files reviewed - Health case records from Women's and Children's Hospital|  Families SA case records|  Disability Services case records  Duane died of pneumonia and complications due to lissencephaly.  Aspiration occurred during a seizure.  This is a child who suffered serious injury at 15 months of age and died of natural causes.  The review of files have demonstrated that serious injury occurred and certainly damaged this children's quality of life.  The practice was tight around the child protection process that led to determination of custody arrangements / residence.  The Department did follow up on child protection concerns relating to the twins ?but subsequently to mother and the offender of the assault on Duane.  Some concerns about the way FAYS engaged in case management but no other issues we can pursue.  However note in particular 'ending' letter to parents of twins - facile in comparison with letter to Case 221 mother at closure.  Feb 2012 - For report to medical team and recording in database.  Medical Screening team - March 2012 - note as a serious injury case also

"998|13/6/13 Screened by the Medical screening team.  Barb Tiffin had considered the opportunities for systemic change relating to this case - homebirth and risk factors.  Barbara Tiffin reported on issues raised about home births in relation to this case.  Case 998 involved a home birth attended by Lisa Barrett.  On 31 October 2012 the Health & Community Complaints Commissioner’s office published a report on the investigation into a complaint about Lisa Barrett.  However"| as there are no sanctions in the HCSC Act for disregarding the Commissioner’s recommendations contained in the report| publication merely act as information and a warning to the public that Lisa Barrett has been the subject of a complaint under the Act.   One of the 5  Recommendations arising out of the Inquest into deaths of  Tate Spencer-Koch| Jahli Jean Hobbs and Tully Oliver Kavanagh (births all attended by Lisa Barrett) has been partially implemented:  The first part of Recommendation 1 - that section 10 of the Health and Community Services Complaints (Miscellaneous) Amendment Act 2011 be brought into operation - was implemented by the commencement of the Act on 14 March 2013.   The Act now provides for Codes of Conduct to be prescribed for| and for the Commissioner to take action against| unregistered practitioners.  (However| the legislation is aimed at regulation of health service providers who fall outside the ambit of operation of a registration authority| so it is unlikely that the provision of midwifery services is captured.)  The second part of Recommendation  1 – that legislation be introduced that would render it an offence for a person to engage in the practice of midwifery without being a midwife or a medical practitioner registered pursuant to the National Law - is apparently being introduced in July this year.     A consultation paper about this proposal was on the SA Health website earlier this year but the Committee was not aware of it.    The Committee discussed information content on birthing that is available on the internet.   It was agreed that SA Health should be responsible for releasing correct information about home birthing.    Action:  Letter to SA Health supporting the proposed legislation to introduce an offence preventing non registered practitioners engaging in midwifery.

B.  > Hi Sharyn"|  >   > I have read this one closely and have a few questions/observations.  >   > Is the documentation complete| and was there in fact a coronial inquest?  >   > It is clearly a case of misdiagnosis| but of course that does not mean that any doctor or even the system was at fault.  The autopsy report is quite clear that the child died from peritonitis presumably caused by the bowel perforation.  The seriousness of the stomach injury was not appreciated.  There was even a bizarre suggestion from a nurse at Strathalbyn that the vomiting might have been the result of a viral gastro.  Now that would be an extraordinary co-incidence| since the vomiting and pain came on just after the fall.  >   > I could not find a statement from the first doctor at WCH|  Dr McMellon.  This would be an important statement.  I say this because there are aspects of Dr Pearton’s statement that are troubling and it would be useful to contrast her statement with that of her junior colleague.  Dr Pearton says that she wrote her notes without reference to records from the time of the admission| some three days before.  She has remembered a great deal of detail| including the dob of the child.  Of course| she may have a very good memory.  On the other hand| she may have looked at contemporaneous records to make her notes.  >   > Dr Pearton failed to notice that LB had a fever.  She reported that she was afebrile| but admitted that she had not seen the note to the effect that her temperature was 38 degrees.  This must have been of some significance since to my layman’s mind it suggests that she had an infection.  She also says that the child’s pulse and bp were slight elevated but does not say what they were.  At Strathalbyn hospital earlier that evening| the pulse was 130.  >   > Dr Pearton strongly denies that LB reported falling on her stomach.  She suggests that she directly asked her whether she did| but was told that she only fell on her hand.  And yet LB seems to have told everyone else that she fell on her stomach.  She reportedly said that to Dr Man and to her mother.  Why would she not report this to Dr Pearton.  Dr Pearton also gives a very different account of LB climbing onto the bed| saying that she did it easily without pain.  This contrasts with the mother’s report.  From Dr Pearton’s report I infer that the mother is correct in concluding that the doctor thought LB was exaggerating in her description of pain. Dr Pearton’s assessment of the child’s pain level is at odds with everyone else’s assessment.  >   > It would also be useful to see the Xray| or scan reports from the WCH and to be assisted by some opinion as to whether the correct diagnostic tests were used.  Does the jumping test (for peritoneal irritation) have any credibility?  >   > Looking at the accident itself| there is no info as to whether this was a standard swing| and whether supervision was adequate| although it is clear that no adult witnessed the incident.  LB seems to have fallen from a great height.  >   > I do not want to be difficult| but I am not fully satisfied with the level of documentation that I have seen.  It may be of course that other documents simply do not exist| but I would be shocked if Dr McMellon was not asked for a statement.  >   > Dr Man’s seems to have been very honest.  She blames herself for not examining the child’s abdomen when she saw her the second time.  >   > I hope it is okay to send this by email.  >   > Mike Ahern  > Solicitor
